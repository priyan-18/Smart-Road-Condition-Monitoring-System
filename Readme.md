# Smart Road Condition Monitoring System

## Introduction
Road safety is a major concern in India due to damaged roads, potholes, and poor maintenance.
Manual road inspection methods are slow and inefficient.
This project proposes an AI-based solution to detect road damage automatically.

## Problem Statement
Potholes and surface damage are usually detected only after accidents occur.
The absence of real-time monitoring and accurate location data delays maintenance
and increases safety risks.

## Proposed Solution
The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze road images or videos
captured from vehicles or smartphones.
Detected road damage is tagged with GPS location data and displayed on a map-based dashboard.
This helps authorities take preventive maintenance actions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning (Conceptual)
- Google Maps API
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Status
This repository contains a conceptual implementation and documentation
created as part of a pre-training hackathon activity.

## Future Scope
- Real-time detection using live video streams
- Integration with government road maintenance systems
- Mobile application for public reporting
